Usage:
Open programm and input needed pics names via ',', or type '*' to open all files in folder.
After that wait +- 2 sec and go to the programm's dir, file named 'texture.png' will appear (or replace old)
NOTE: don't use files named 'texture.png', or it will be replaced by generated one!

Errors:
There's an error with image:
    (image name)

It means that the programm can't open image by some cause (it's not image, it's corrupted and etc.). If you selected all files, just nevermind, else, check the pic's name, you may write it wrong.
